# Advolition

Advolition is a roguelike adventure game in which 1-4 players program robots that compete to explore a randomly generated dungeon and collect items that increase their power and wealth.

The robots are programmed by creating and uploading JavaScript classes that the game engine uses to determine how each of the machines responds to its environment.

The only factors that distinguish one robot from one another are their programs and the items that they find and equip in the dungeon. These items affect the robots' abilities and add their overall scores. The robot with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

I'm creating the game to help teach students how to program in object oriented programming languages like JavaScript.
