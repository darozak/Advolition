        <h1>Welcome to Advolition</h1> 
        <a href="game.html" >Start Game</a>
        <p>Advolition is a Roughlike game in which 1-4 players program robots to explore a dungeon and collect items that contribute to their power and wealth.</p>
        <p>The robots are programmed in Javascript.</p>

        <h1>Programming your robot</h1>
        <p>Each robot is programmed by creating a js file that describes a new JavaScript class.  The new class also needs to extend the Program class and contain a run function that accepts three variables: myID, myData, and myAction and returns myAction.  Finally, it's necessary to create a new unknamed object from your class at the end of the script.</p>

        <p>The following is an example of a minimal robot script.</p>
        <pre>
            class MyProgram extends Program {
                run(myID, myData, myAction) {             
                    return myAction;
                }          
            }            
            new MyProgram();
        </pre>
    </main>
