# Advolition Game Design Manual

## Dungeons
Dungeons will be layed out in a grid with one or more objects occupying each space.

## Objects
Only one object can occupy a space at a time.  Objects include doors, walls, monsters, etc...

## Features
These are details that can share a space with something else.

## Delays
Every action has a delay before it takes effect. This delay depends on the type of equipment that is being used to perform the action.

When an action is in a delay state, it cannot be aborted and another action of the same type cannot be initiated until the first action is complete.

## Scanners
Scanners are the robot's vision.  They are the way that it senses its environment.  Scanners determine how far the robot can see, what it can see, and what it can see through.

Different scanners are better at seeing some types of materials and worse at seeing others. Some scanners can completely see through things.

Scanners also differ in their range.

Scanners also have different scan rates.  So some take longer to scan a room than others.

Some scanners might be good at finding secret doors.

## Power
Actions consume different amounts of power depending on the type of equipment that is being used. A robot must find power sources to recharge it's power.
